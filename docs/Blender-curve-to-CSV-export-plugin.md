# Curve vertices to CSV export tool for Blender

To install this plugin open Blender and click Edit > Preferences, click on the Add Ons tab, then click “Install…” in the top right corner of the window. Navigate to the add on file, then click “Install Add-on” in the lower right.

To export the verticies convert the curve to a **Mesh** if it is not already. 
In Object Mode, select the mesh in the scene and go to File > Export > Curve verticies to CSV Export

This will produce a CSV file in the directory where the Blender project is saved with XYZ coordinates for the verticies in relation to the global coordinate plane
